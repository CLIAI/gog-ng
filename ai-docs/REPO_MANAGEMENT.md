## USE `FUTURE_WORK.md` file
* We collect all ideas, observations of things to investigate, debug, consider making tests, for, profiling, whatever, work ideas or new features to explore etc in `FUTURE_WORK.md` file.
* We write to each `## section Pxxx` priority P, by default in increments of 10 so we have space in between to put sth if needed, the lower number the higher priority, and usually we try to keep P000-P099 range empty for highest priority/urgent tasks
* We move completed sections into `ramblings/${YYDDMM}-DONE_WORK.md`

## USE `CURRENT_WORK.md`
We keep context in all those files so incase work would be interrupted and someone fresh would come with no memory and recollection, that such person can recover state, context and continue work were was left.
